### Projects

## [Forecasting Churn of Customers](https://github.com/vinipta-s/Forecasting_Churn_of_Customers/tree/main)
<br><br>
<b>A telecom operator aimed to forecast customer churn, focusing on building a predictive model with an AUC-ROC score of at least 0.87.
Feature engineered was done with the available features.</b>
<li>
  Developed machine learning models, including LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, CatBoostClassifier and a VotingClassifier, to identify customers at risk of churning.
</li>
<li>
  Achieved the highest performance with the CatBoostClassifier, tuned through StratifiedKFold and RandomizedSearchCV for optimal hyperparameters.
</li>

## [Starbucks Reviews Analysis and Sentiment Prediction](https://github.com/vinipta-s/Starbucks_Reviews_Sentiment_Prediction)
<br><br>
<b> Analyzed Starbucks customer reviews from various locations within the US to identify popular review topics and build a model to classify reviews as positive or negative using two different text processing methods.</b>
<li>
  Cleaned and filtered dataset to include only US-based reviews.
</li>
<li>
  Method 1: Applied text normalization techniques, followed by lemmatization using NLTK, and obtained padded sequences.
</li>
<li>
  Method 2: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
</li>
<li>
  Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier and LGBMClassifier models on each processed review set. 
</li>
<li>
  Achieved the best performance with a Logistic Regression model using the BERT embeddings. Obtained an accuracy of 0.94, 0.92 ROC-AUC, and an F1 score of 0.85.
</li>
